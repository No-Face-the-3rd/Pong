Scope-
The goal of this project was to create a pong game that used the spinning of the ball to change the trajectory on bounce. 
Paddles could change the spin if hit in certain locations.There was intended to be assorted powerups that affected paddles and balls.
I was unable to get the powerups functioning prior to the due date.
Technologies-
I used the SFW.lib provided because I wanted to see what I would be able to make using it.
I referenced StackOverflow several times for various reasons, but usually to see the syntax and to remind myself exactly how functions worked.
Failures-
I was unable to get the powerups done in time. I had intended to make the ball retain a certain overall velocity, but that fell through and I ended up just modifying the
overall velocity if it fell outside of a range. Also, I was unable to get the ai to function exactly how I desired.
Challenges -

Conclusion -
I would set a trajectory variable to the paddle to allow an easier implementation of the ai.
